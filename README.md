>Horrid virus made to show how evil viruses can be, and how bad antiviruses are, as it goes undercover. This worm is a half-email half-network based not-so-ransomeware type malware. It will basically ruin all of your files, including windows files. It is just... a bad time.
# BIG WARNING
Don't run it. Just don't. It will actually be a bad thing, and a problem. Use it in a closed enviroment with no internet access. In a VM. You'll get bricked if not. WE AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES!
